                This single-page application mimicks the famous mines game. The page uses jQuery and JavaScript. I put it quickly together after reading the "Learning jQuery" by J. Chaffer and K. Swedberg. It is a proof-of-concept rather than production code, and it demonstrates the power and ease of using jQuery and JavaScript. The game currently does not open the adjacent cells when a cell with no mines around is clicked, but the book about algorithms is one of the next books that I will read.

                This page allows user to encode the text in such a way that the first and last letter of each word is kept in place, but all the letters in between are scrambled. Altering data this way may make it impossible to translate it into another language using the automated translation services. This project uses JavaScript, all data stays on client, server keeps no data.

                This project was a demo for high-school Science, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) Fair. This primitive Windows Phone game demonstrates how easy it is to create and animate a character as well as how to add a background. The program also simulates basics of gravitation and responds to touches by moving the character to the touched point. The dots mark the character's movement. It takes 15 minutes to build such functionality on Windows Phone from ground up.
