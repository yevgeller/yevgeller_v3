This primitive Windows Phone game demonstrates how easy it is to create and animate a character as well as how to add a background. The program also simulates basics of gravitation and responds to touches by moving the character to the touched point. The dots mark the character's movement. It takes 15 minutes to build such functionality on Windows Phone from ground up.",
